    <h3>Upma Making Process</h3>
    
        <p class="li1">1.Prepare Ingredients: Gather and chop your ingredients. You’ll need semolina (rava/sooji), onions, green chilies, ginger, curry leaves, mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, and any vegetables you like (e.g., carrots, peas). You’ll also need salt and oil.</p>
        <p class="li2">2.Roast Semolina: Heat a pan over medium heat and dry roast the semolina until it turns light golden and aromatic. Set aside.
        </p>
        <p>3.Cook the Base: In the same pan, heat some oil. Add mustard seeds, and when they start to splutter, add urad dal and chana dal. Sauté until they turn golden. Then, add chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. Cook until onions are translucent. Add any vegetables you’re using and cook until tender.</p>
        <p>4.Make Upma: Add water to the pan (about 2 cups for every 1 cup of semolina) and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and slowly add the roasted semolina, stirring continuously to prevent lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens and the semolina is fully cooked. Add salt to taste and garnish with fresh coriander or a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.</p>

    <h3>Aloo Fry Making Process</h3>
    
        <p class="li1">1.Prepare Potatoes: Peel and cut potatoes into small, uniform pieces. You can soak them in water for a few minutes to remove excess starch, which helps them fry up crispier. Drain and pat them dry with a towel.</p>
        <p class="li2">2.Heat Oil and Add Spices: In a pan, heat some oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds (optional), and when they start to sizzle, add a pinch of turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala (or any spices you prefer). Stir to mi</p>
        <p>3.Fry Potatoes: Add the potato pieces to the pan and toss them to coat with the spices. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender inside. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes. You can cover the pan with a lid for the first few minutes to help them cook faster.</p>
        <p>4.Season and Garnish: Once the potatoes are cooked, add salt to taste and mix well. Garnish with chopped fresh coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice if you like. Serve hot.</p>

    <h3>Chicken Curry Making Process</h3>

        <p class="li1">1.Prepare Ingredients: Chop onions, garlic, and ginger. Cut chicken into pieces. Gather spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and chili powder. You might also want tomatoes or tomato puree, and some fresh cilantro for garnish.</p>
        <p class="li2">2.Cook the Base: Heat oil in a pan and sauté chopped onions until golden brown. Add garlic and ginger and cook for another minute. Then add spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, chili powder) and cook briefly until fragrant. Stir in tomatoes or tomato puree and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate.</p>
        <p>3.Add Chicken: Add chicken pieces to the pan and mix well with the spice mixture. Cook for a few minutes until the chicken starts to brown. Add water or chicken broth to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally and adjust the consistency of the curry with more water if needed.</p>
        <p>4.Finish and Serve: Add garam masala, salt to taste, and stir well. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with rice, naan, or your favorite side.</p>
